#The Fizz Buzz Problem 

A repo for the a simple fizzbuzz solution and another with an extensible
version.

It should be run on the command line with Python.  

The fizzbuzz problem iterates through a designated series of numbers and
returns a "fizz" for multiples of 3, buzz for multilples of 5, and a
"fizzbuzz" for multiples of 3 and 5 combined.  

**The Challenge: Write a method that takes one number as an argument. For multiples of 
three return “Fizz”, and for the multiples of five return “Buzz”. 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five return “FizzBuzz”,
and in all other cases return the number (as a string).**

Lots of assistance provide by Cris Ewing ([cewing](https://github.com/cewing)) with the extensible 
dictionary related version.
